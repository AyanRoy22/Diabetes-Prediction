# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction
The objective of this problem is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Relevant Information:
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

Number of Instances: 768
Number of Attributes: 8 plus class 

For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)
   1. Number of times pregnant
   2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   7. Diabetes pedigree function
   8. Age (years)
   9. Class variable (0 or 1)

Class Distribution: (class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for diabetes")

   Class Value  Number of instances
   0            500
   1            268
